# Sprouty Dialogs Manager
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## This class is used as the autoload that manages the Sprouty Dialogs plugin.
##
## Keep track of the running dialog players and dialog states by signals.
##
## Also, allows to start a dialog with the [method start_dialog] method directly
## from code, without needing to create a dialog player instance in the scene.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Emitted when the dialog starts.
signal dialog_started()
## Emitted when the dialog is paused.
signal dialog_paused()
## Emitted when the dialog is resumed.
signal dialog_resumed()
## Emitted when the dialog is ended.
signal dialog_ended()

## Emitted when a dialog option is selected.
signal option_selected(option_index: int, option_dialog: Dictionary)
## Emitted when a signal event is emitted.
signal signal_event(signal_id: String, args: Array)

## The list of dialog players currently running.
## This is used to keep track of multiple dialog players running at the same time.

#region === Run dialog =========================================================
## Start a dialog with the given data and start ID.
## This will create a new dialog player instance and start it.
## Also, [b]will load the resources needed for the dialog, such as characters, 
## dialog boxes, and portraits, before starting the dialog player.[/b][br][br]
##
## [color=red][b]This may cause a slowdown if resources are large.[/b][/color]
## It is recommended to start the dialog from a previously created
## [DialogPlayer] instance instead of calling this method from here. 
## The dialog player will handle the resource loading on _ready(), loading the
## resources only once and reusing them for the dialog.
